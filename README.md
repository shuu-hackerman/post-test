# Running a RESTApi in a REACT APP.

Let me first introduce myself, My name is Henrique Trindade and I have 25 yrs. I received a tst proposal for this job application, then when I see the test I realize the test is for a Frond-End with React.
Let me explain I'm a Architecure and Urbanism, first what I study Data Analyse in programming area, more specificly with Matplotlib and Pandas, Django for some DB and recently I start study AWS Cloud Archtecture for my Final Papper project with these languages. 
So, I'm sending for u what I did it stuying the documents from react (https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) then I see its not a lot of diference of FLASK from Python Lib, For that I never get to study react before, I know JS and I have some project's in JS like a website with HTML+CSS and I have 2 Bots on my channel that I manage then with JS Scripts. But my area of programming is not Front-End with React, I'm thinking this job only will need HTML+CSS+JS. I Din't have much time to complete all the tasks for the Test, but I think I show what I can do it and what I know for that Jr. Job
